# Speech Feedback

Here's some feedback on your speech:

* **Filler words**: You started your speech with two "hellos" which can be seen as filler words. Try to begin with a stronger opening that grabs your mom's attention. Consider starting with a hook, a personal story, or a rhetorical question that sets the tone for the rest of your speech.
* **Projection of voice**: Unfortunately, I couldn't assess the projection of your voice as the transcript doesn't provide audio data. However, when speaking to your mom, make sure to project your voice clearly and confidently, so she can hear you without straining. Speak from your diaphragm, and avoid mumbling or speaking too softly.
* **Speed**: The transcript is quite short, but it seems like you might be speaking a bit slowly or hesitantly. Try to find a comfortable pace that allows you to convey your message without rushing or dragging. Aim for a conversational tone, and don't be afraid to pause for emphasis or to let your mom absorb what you're saying.
* **Understandability**: Your speech is currently quite unclear, as you haven't actually said anything substantive yet! To improve understandability, make sure to clearly state your main point or goal, and provide some supporting evidence or examples to convince your mom. Use simple, concise language that she can easily follow, and try to avoid jargon or technical terms that might confuse her.

To take your speech to the next level, consider adding some humor, as you mentioned you want to aim for a funny tone. Think about what makes your mom laugh, and try to incorporate some lighthearted anecdotes or witty one-liners to keep her engaged and entertained. Good luck!
